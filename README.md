This is a task on the curriculum of The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com).

I'm still having some problems on how to use codes in the right time. Had a really hard time on the Math problems, but I'm going to keep studying and hope I catch those coding methods. These 3 problems I used some students solution help, but I could understand the coding they've used. This is good!
